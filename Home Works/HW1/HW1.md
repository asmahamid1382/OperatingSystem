#### In the first stage, each of the n students competes individually and earns some points. A list of the names, ages, and scores obtained by the students in the first stage is given as input. In the second stage, the groups will consist of two members, and the selection of members is done as follows: The first member of each group is selected from the beginning, and the second member is selected from the end of the input list, and they are placed in a group together. In the output, you should print the group specifications in order of the average scores of the members (from highest to lowest).
